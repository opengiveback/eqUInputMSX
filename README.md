# eqUInputMSX
PCB and Arduino sourcecode for Arduino Nano based PS/2 to MSX mouse converter

Arduino sourcecode is a slightly modified version of this "PS/2-mouse to MSX v1.0" code by  NYYRIKKI : https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/hardware/use-10eu-connect-modern-mouse-msx

As requested and tested by Darko Radicevic, MSX afficionado. Converted from Amiga version of my eqUInput PCB.
