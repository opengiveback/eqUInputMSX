# eqUInputMSX
PCB and Arduino sourcecode for Arduino Nano based PS/2 to MSX mouse converter

Arduino sourcecode is a slightly modified version of this "PS/2-mouse to MSX v1.0" code by  NYYRIKKI : https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/hardware/use-10eu-connect-modern-mouse-msx

As requested and tested by Darko Radicevic, MSX afficionado. Converted from Amiga version of my eqUInput PCB.

CAUTION! Do NOT connect USB cable to Arduino Nano while the device is inserted into the MSX.

The PS/2 part of PCB was tested by Darko Radicevic to work good on a physical MSX machine, on a modified Amiga version of the PCB. This one wires MSX DB9 joystick port correctly for MSX. DO NOT USE THIS PCB FOR AMIGA/ATARI/SEGA, MSX ONLY!
